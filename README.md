# cit225
This repository is dedicated to Oracle SQL projects written for the CIT 225 Database Design and Development class taught by Brother McLaughlin at BYU-Idaho during the Spring 2017 Semester.

Each student was provided a Fedora image containing an operational Oracle environment, and all commands were executed using the SQLPlus command line interface.

Links to the lab instructions are listed on the right-hand side of http://michaelmclaughlin.info/db1/ under the links to the lesson categories.
